## Prototypal inheritance

- Link: https://javascript.info/prototype-inheritance
- Prototypal inheritance is JS’ way of allowing an object to *extend* or *inherit behaviour* from another object.`[[Prototype]]` is a hidden internal object field which is used to enable this.
- If a field doesn’t exist on an object, the JS engine follows the *prototype chain* to search for the field.

    ```js
    let animal = {
        eats: true,
        walk() {
            alert("Animal walk");
        }
    };

    let rabbit = {
        jumps: true,
        __proto__: animal
    };

    let longEar = {
        earLength: 10,
        __proto__: rabbit
    };

    // walk is taken from the prototype chain
    longEar.walk(); // Animal walk
    alert(longEar.jumps); // true (from rabbit)
    ```

- There is another field `__proto__` which exists for historical reasons. It is a historical getter/setter for `[[Prototype]]`. Modern JS way of getting/setting prototype is by using `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) / Object.setPrototypeOf(objA, objB)`
- In a method call, the value of `this` is always decided by the *object behind the .(dot)…* even if a method is found in the prototype chain
    
    ```jsx
    let animal = {
    	run() {
    		this.isRunning = true
    	}
    }
    
    let elephant = {
    	__proto__: animal
    }
    
    elephant.run();
    elephant.isRunning // true
    animal.isRunning // undefined
    ```
    

## F.prototype

- Link: https://javascript.info/function-prototype
- We will be talking about the `prototype` object field here. We will be analysing the behaviour of literally setting the `prototype` property to a function.
- Setting Animal.prototype = animal literally states, when a new object is created using `new Animal`, set its `[[Prototype]]` property to the `animal`.  The `"prototype"` property only has such a special effect when set on a constructor function, and invoked with `new`. On regular objects the `prototype` is nothing special.

    ```js
    let animal = {
      eats: true
    };

    function Rabbit(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    Rabbit.prototype = animal;

    let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit"); //  rabbit.__proto__ == animal

    alert( rabbit.eats ); // true
    ```

- Every function has a default prototype assigned to it
    
    ```js
    function Test() {}
    // Test.prototype = { constructor: Test }
    Test.prototype.constructor === Test // true
    
    let testChild = new Test()
    
    testChild.prototype === Test.prototype
    testChild.constructor === Test
    ```
