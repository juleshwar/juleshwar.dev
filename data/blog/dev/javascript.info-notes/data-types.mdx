## Methods of primitives
- Link: https://javascript.info/primitives-methods
- The JS Engine implicitly converts the primitive into a relevant object with helper methods. This is for ease of use.
    
    ```jsx
    let str = "hi"
    log(str.toUpperCase()) // HI
    
    /**
     * Behind the scenes line 2 looks like console.log((new String("hi")).toUpperCase())
    */
    ```
    
    Here’s what happens
    
    1. `str` is a primitive. To achieve this, a temp **`String`** **object** is created which has all these useful methods.
    2. The method runs and outputs the result.
    3. The temp object is destroyed.
    
    **The object only exists during the running of that line and is promptly destroyed.**
    
- `new Number/Boolean/String` is an anti-pattern!
    
    ```jsx
    // Anti-pattern
    let zero = new Number(0)
    console.log(typeof zero) // **object!
    
    //** Instead do this
    zero = Number("0")
    console.log(typeof zero) // number
    ```
    
    Instead you can just use the constructor without the `new` for type conversion
    

## Numbers

- Link: https://javascript.info/number
- https://javascript.info/number#more-ways-to-write-a-number
    
    ```jsx
    // All are the same number!
    const oneB_0 = 1200000000
    const oneB_1 = 1_200_000_000
    const oneB_2 = 1.2e9 // You can even do **1.2e-2 for 0.012**
    ```
    
- https://javascript.info/number#tostring-base
    
    ```jsx
    // This is not a typo 😱
    log( 123456..toString(36) ); // 2n9c -> converted to base 36. But notice the 2 dots
    ```
    
    If we called a method on a number with just one dot, the compiler would think we are making a mistake and missing numbers after the decimal. Two dots tells the compiler that there is nothing after the decimal point. We can also do `(123).toString()`
    
- 64 bits are used to store a number: 52 of them are used to store the digits, 11 of them store the position of the decimal point, and 1 bit is for the sign.
- https://javascript.info/number#tests-isfinite-and-isnan
    
    `Number.isNaN` is a stricter version of `isNaN`
    
    ```jsx
    alert( Number.isNaN("str") ); // false, because "str" belongs to the string type, not the number type
    alert( isNaN("str") ); // true, because isNaN converts string "str" into a number and gets NaN as a result of this conversion
    ```
    

## Strings

- Link: https://javascript.info/string
- Ways to make a string with line breaks.
    
    ```jsx
    'Hola \n Soy Fabiano' // Single quotes
    "Hello \n I'm Wesley" // Double quotes
    `
    	Konichiwa
    	Hikaru desu
    ` // Backticks
    ```
    
    - We get an `Unexpected EOF` error if we use ↲ while using quotes
        
        ```jsx
        let a = "Hello
        World"
        ```
        
- Tagged Templates #til #advanced
    - Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates)
    - Template tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The first argument of a tag function contains an array of string values. The remaining arguments are related to the expressions.
        
        ```jsx
        const doIntroduction = function(strings, playerName, favSport) {
        	const [str0, str1] = strings // ["Hello, I'm ", " and I love playing ", ""]
        	return str0 + playerName + str1 + favSport
        }
        
        const name = "Ding"
        const favGame = "Chess"
        
        doIntroduction`Hello, I'm ${name} and I love playing ${favGame}` // Hello, I'm Ding and I love playing Chess
        ```
        
    - All of this is allowed
        1. property access
        2. function call
        3. `new Function` syntax
        4. Another tagged template literal 
        
        ```jsx
        console.log`Hello`; // [ 'Hello' ]
        console.log.bind(1, 2)`Hello`; // 2 [ 'Hello' ]
        new Function("console.log(arguments)")`Hello`; // [Arguments] { '0': [ 'Hello' ] }
        
        function recursive(strings, ...values) {
          console.log(strings, values);
          return recursive;
        }
        recursive`Hello``World`;
        // [ 'Hello' ] []
        // [ 'World' ] []
        ```
        
    - A simple way to understand this is “the syntax `func`tempLiteral`` breaks down the template literal into an array with two values, [0] having all the string literals and [1] having all the dynamic properties a.k.a `${}`
        
        
        - Consider the example `console.log.bind(null, 1)`Hello ${2}``. This is indeed a complex example but it will help deepen the understanding of what’s happening. The output for this code is
        
        ```jsx
        1
        [
        	["Hello", ""],
        	2
        ]
        ```
        
        - When we call `console.log.bind(null, 1)` it prints `1` onto the console, then the returned `console.log` function is called with ``Hello ${2}``. The JS engine splits the literal into `[["Hello”, “”], 2]` which is passed to `console.log` and it prints it as it is.

## Arrays

- Link: https://javascript.info/array
- https://javascript.info/array#get-last-elements-with-at
    
    ```jsx
    let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
    alert( fruits.at(-1) ); // Plum -> same as fruits[fruits.length-1]
    ```
    
- https://javascript.info/array#internals
    
    The ways to misuse an array:
    
    - Add a non-numeric property like `arr.test = 5`.
    - Make holes, like: add `arr[0]` and then `arr[1000]` (and nothing between them).
    - Fill the array in the reverse order, like `arr[1000]`, `arr[999]` and so on.
    
    Any of such misuse removes the optimisations the JS engine reserves for an array #anti-pattern
    
- https://javascript.info/array#performance 🤯
    
    Methods `push/pop` run fast, while `shift/unshift` are slow. Because the whole array needs to be reindexed in case of `shift/unshift`
    
- https://javascript.info/array#loops
    
    Using `for…in` for arrays is not advised for a couple of reasons #anti-pattern
    
    1. The loop `for..in` iterates over *all properties*, not only the numeric ones. If you have a object which behaves like an array (has indexed props and length prop), 
    2. The `for..in` loop is optimized for generic objects, not arrays, and thus is 10-100 times slower.
    
    Use `for..of` or the ye oldie `for` loop
