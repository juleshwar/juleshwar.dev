## Recursion & Stack

- Link: https://javascript.info/recursion
- The maximal number of nested calls in a recursion is called its *recursion depth.*
- https://javascript.info/recursion#the-execution-context-and-stack
    
    The [execution context](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-execution-contexts) is an internal data structure that contains details about the execution of a function: where the control flow is now, the current variables, the value of `this` and few other internal details.
    
    One function call has exactly one execution context associated with it.
    
    When a function makes a nested call, the following happens:
    
    - The current function is paused.
    - The execution context associated with it is remembered in a special data structure called *execution context stack*.
    - The nested call executes.
    - After it ends, the old execution context is retrieved from the stack, and the outer function is resumed from where it stopped.

## Rest Parameters & Spread Syntax

- Link: https://javascript.info/rest-parameters-spread
- The spread operator can be used in a function definition to *collect* all the incoming/rest of the arguments into an array. The dots literally mean “gather the remaining parameters into an array”.
    
    ```jsx
    function sumAll(...args) { // args is the name for the array
    	return args.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0)
    }
    
    alert( sumAll(1) ); // 1
    alert( sumAll(1, 2) ); // 3
    alert( sumAll(1, 2, 3) ); // 6
    ```
    
- https://javascript.info/rest-parameters-spread#the-arguments-variable
    
    `arguments` is an **array-like** object in a traditional function which has all the arguments by their index. Although `arguments` is both array-like and iterable, it’s not an array.
    
    ```jsx
    function logName(fName, lName) {
    	for(let name of arguments) { **// Iterable**
    		console.log(name) // "Daniel", "Naroditsky"
    	}
    
    	**// Array-like**
    	console.log(arguments[0]) // "Daniel"
    	console.log(arguments[1]) // "Naroditsky"
    
    	// Not an array!
    	**console.log(arguments.map) // undefined!**
    
    	console.log("Hi I'm ", arguments[0], " ", arguments[1])
    }
    
    logName("Daniel", "Naroditsky")
    ```
    
- https://javascript.info/rest-parameters-spread#the-arguments-variable
    
    Arrow functions don’t have the `arguments` array. If we try to access the array inside an arrow function, it takes the array from the closest traditional function parent
    
- Difference between `Array.from` and `…`
    
    `Array.from` converts both *iterables* and *array-likes* into an array. But `…` only converts iterables into arrays
        
        ```jsx
        const arrayLike = {
        	0: "A",
        	1: "B",
        	2: "C",
          length: 3
        }
        
        const iterable = {
        	from: 1,
        	to: 4,
        
        	[Symbol.iterator]: function() {
        		return {
        			current: this.from,
        			last: this.to,
        
        			next() {
        				if(this.current <= this.last) {
        					return { value: this.current++, done: false}				
        				}
        				return { done: true }
        			}
        		}
        	}
        }
        
        console.log(Array.from(arrayLike)); // ["A", "B", "C"]
        console.log(Array.from(iterable)); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
        
        console.log([...iterable]) // [1, 2, 3, 4]
        [...arrayLike] // Uncaught TypeError: arrayLike is not iterable
        ```
        
- We can use `{code blocks}` to isolate a piece of code that does its own task, with variables that only belong to it. 
    
    ```jsx
    {
      // show message
      let message = "Hello";
      alert(message);
    }
    
    {
      // show another message
      let message = "Goodbye";
      alert(message);
    }
    ```
    

## Variable Scope & Closure

- Link: https://javascript.info/closure
- https://javascript.info/closure#lexical-environment
    
    Every running function, code block `{...}`, and the script as a whole have an internal (hidden) associated object known as the *Lexical Environment*. Theoretically, each function is supposed to have a `[[Environment]]` property which links it to its Lexical Environment
    
    The Lexical Environment object consists of two parts:
    
    1. *Environment Record* – an object that stores all local variables as its properties (and some other information like the value of `this`).
    2. A reference to the *outer lexical environment*, the one associated with the outer code.
    - **Variables**
        
        **A “variable” is just a property of the special internal object, `Environment Record`. “To get or change a variable” means “to get or change a property of that object”.**
        
        The outermost LE is the *global LE* whose outer LE is `null`

    - **Function Declarations**
        
        A function is also a value, like a variable.
        
        **The difference is that a Function Declaration is instantly fully initialized.**
        
        When a Lexical Environment is created, a Function Declaration immediately becomes a ready-to-use function (unlike `let`, that is unusable till the declaration).
        
        That’s why we can use a function, declared as Function Declaration, even before the declaration itself. #til
        
        <Image src="/static/images/blog/javascript.info-notes/advanced-working-with-functions/function-declaration-lexical-environment.png" width={5000} height={500} alt="Functions are instantly fully initialised in the lexical environment"/>
        
    
    - **Inner & Outer Lexical Environment**
        
        When a function runs, at the beginning of the call, a new Lexical Environment is created automatically to store local variables and parameters of the call. #til
        
        **When the code wants to access a variable – the inner Lexical Environment is searched first, then the outer one, then the more outer one and so on until the global one.** This is very similar to the how the prototype chain is followed to find a property.

    - **Returning a function**
        
        
        ```jsx
        function makeCounter() {
          let count = 0;
        
          return function() {
            return count++;
          };
        }
        
        let counter = makeCounter();
        let counter2 = makeCounter();
        
        console.log(counter()) // 0
        console.log(counter()) // 1
        console.log(counter()) // 2
        
        console.log(counter2()) // 0
        ```
        
        At the beginning of each `makeCounter()` call, a **new Lexical Environment object** is created, to store variables for this `makeCounter` run.
        
        *What’s different from above use-case is that during the execution of `makeCounter()`, a tiny nested function is created of only one line: `return count++`. We don’t run it yet, only create.*
        
        So, `counter.[[Environment]]` has the reference to `{count: 0}` Lexical Environment. That’s how the function remembers where it was created, no matter where it’s called. The `[[Environment]]` reference is set once and forever at function creation time.
        
        Later, when `counter()` is called, a new Lexical Environment is created for the call, and its outer Lexical Environment reference is taken from `counter.[[Environment]]`
        
        Now when the code inside `counter()` looks for `count` variable, it first searches its own Lexical Environment (empty, as there are no local variables there), then the Lexical Environment of the outer `makeCounter()` call, where it finds and changes it.
        
        **A variable is updated in the Lexical Environment where it lives.**
        
        💡 the `count: 0` which is green highlighted becomes `count: 1` after execution of `counter()`

        <Image src="/static/images/blog/javascript.info-notes/advanced-working-with-functions/lexical-environment-demarcation.png" width={5000} height={500} alt="Demarcations showing where the lexical environment for a function ends and the global lexical environment begins"/>
        
        ### Closure
        
        A [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them. In JS, all functions are naturally closures (there is only one exception, to be covered in [The "new Function" syntax](https://javascript.info/new-function)).
        
        That is: they automatically remember where they were created using a hidden `[[Environment]]` property, and then their code can access outer variables.
        
        ### Dead Zone

        ```jsx
        // Variable is present but uninitialized
        function func() {
          console.log(someVal); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'someVal' before initialization
          let someVal = 1;
        }

        func();
        ```

        ```jsx
        // Variable is present but uninitialized
        let someVal = 1;

        function func() {
          // First it checks the current lexical environment before checking the outer one. The variable is present but uninitialized
          console.log(someVal); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'someVal' before initialization
          let someVal = 2;
        }

        func();
        ```
        ```jsx
        // Variable does not exist
        function func() {
          console.log(nonExistingVal); // Uncaught ReferenceError: nonExistingVal is not defined
        }

        func();
        ```

        In this example we can observe the peculiar difference between a “non-existing” and `<uninitialized>` variable.

        A variable starts in the `<uninitialized>` state from the moment when the execution enters a code block (or a function). And it stays `<uninitialized>` until the corresponding `let` statement.

        In other words, a variable technically exists, but can’t be used before `let`. This zone is called the **dead-zone**
