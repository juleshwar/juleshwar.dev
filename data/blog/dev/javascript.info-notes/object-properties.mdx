- There are **two kinds of object properties**.
    - The first kind is *data properties*. All properties that we’ve been using until now were data properties.
        ```js
        let obj = {
            foo: 10
        }

        obj.foo // 10 -> data property
        ```
    - The second type is *accessor property*. They are essentially functions that execute on getting and setting a value, but look like regular properties to an external code.

## Property Flags and Descriptors

- Link: https://javascript.info/property-descriptors
- Object properties, besides a *****value*****, have three special properties so-called “flags”
    - **`writable`** – if `true`, the value can be changed, otherwise it’s read-only.
    - **`enumerable`** – if `true`, then listed in loops, otherwise not listed.
    - **`configurable`** – if `true`, the property can be deleted and these attributes can be modified, otherwise not.
- [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, propName)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor) allows us to see these flags which are generally hidden away. All these three flags are true for props we normally set.
- Using `Object.defineProperty` we can edit these flags for properties. Any flag not mentioned while defining a property is considered `false` by default
- Making a property non-configurable is a one-way road. We cannot change it back with `defineProperty`. The only other change we can make to such a property is make its `writable` flag from `true` to `false`
- Other handy property configurators
    - **[Object.preventExtensions(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/preventExtensions):** Forbids the addition of new properties to the object.
    - **[Object.seal(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal):** Forbids adding/removing of properties. Sets `configurable: false` for all existing properties.
    - **[Object.freeze(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze):** Forbids adding/removing/changing of properties. Sets `configurable: false, writable: false` for all existing properties.

## ****Property Getters and Setters****

- Link: https://javascript.info/property-accessors

    ```jsx
    let obj = {
        get propName() {
            // getter, the code executed on getting obj.propName
        },

        set propName(value) {
            // setter, the code executed on setting obj.propName = value
        }
    };
    ```

- Descriptors for accessor properties are different from those for data properties.
    - **`get`** – a function without arguments, that works when a property is read,
    - **`set`** – a function with one argument, that is called when the property is set,
    - **`enumerable`** – same as for data properties… if false, property doesn’t show up in `for` loops
    - **`configurable`** – same as for data properties... if `true`, the property can be deleted and these *descriptors* can be modified, otherwise not.
- A property can either have a *value* descriptor or *get/set* descriptors. Not both at the same time.
