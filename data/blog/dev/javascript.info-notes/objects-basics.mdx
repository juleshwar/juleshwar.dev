## Garbage Collection
- Link: https://javascript.info/garbage-collection
- JavaScript engine’s garbage collection algorithm is called “mark-and-sweep”. It *marks* the top level objects referred by *global* as *roots* and recursively visits objects referred by the roots. Basically it forms a reference tree. It then *sweeps* any objects not present in this tree. Browsers apply more optimization over this algo like incremental collection, idle-time collection and generational collection to make it practically viable.

## Object methods, “this”

- Link: https://javascript.info/object-methods
- The value of `this` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context. The value of this is the “*object before the dot”* of the property being referenced
    
    ```jsx
    let user1 = { name: "Daniel" }
    let user2 = { name: "Hikaru" }
    
    let sayName = function() {
    	window.alert("Hi, my name is ", this.name}
    }
    
    user1.introduceYourself = sayName
    user2.introduceYourself = sayName
    
    user1.introduceYourself() // Hi, my name is Daniel
    user2.introduceYourself() // Hi, my name is Hikaru
    ```
    
    <aside>
    💡 “That’s because rules that set `this` do not look at object definition. Only the moment of call matters.”
    
    </aside>
    
- `this` for a global object results in `undefined` when in strict mode and the global object when not in strict mode 😲
    
    ```jsx
    function sayHi() {
      alert(this);
    }
    
    sayHi(); // undefined in strict mode
    sayHi(); // global object in non-strict mode
    ```
    

## Constructor, operator "new"

- Link: https://javascript.info/constructor-new
- The main purpose of constructors is to implement **reusable object creation** code.
    
    ```jsx
    function User(name) {  
      // this = {};  (implicitly)
      
      // add properties to this  
      this.name = name;  
      this.person = true;
      
      // return this;  (implicitly)
    }
    
    new User("Hikaru")
    new User("Arjun")
    ```
    
- Constructors do not have a return statement. But if there is a return statement, then the rule is simple:
    - If `return` is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of `this`.
    - If return is called with a primitive, it’s ignored.
- #til
    
    ```jsx
    let user = new User; // <-- no parentheses
    // same as
    let user = new User();
    ```
    

## Symbol type

- Link: https://javascript.info/symbol
- By specification, only two primitive types may serve as object property keys:
    - string type, or
    - symbol type.
    
    Otherwise, if one uses another type, such as number, it’s autoconverted to string. So that `obj[1]` is the same as `obj["1"]`, and `obj[true]` is the same as `obj["true"]`.
    
- Symbols are “primitive unique values”
    
    ```jsx
    let id1 = Symbol("id"); // "id" is just a description for the Symbol
    let id2 = Symbol("id");
    
    alert(id1 === id2); // false
    ```
    
- `for..in` loops or `Object.keys()` skips over Symbol keys in objects
- Technically, symbols are not 100% hidden.
    - There is a built-in method [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols) that allows us to get all symbols.
    - Also there is a method named [Reflect.ownKeys(obj)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/ownKeys) that returns *all* keys of an object including symbolic ones.

## Object to Primitive conversion

- Link: https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive
- JavaScript uses something called *hints* to decide what to convert an object to
    
    ```jsx
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      money: 1000,
    
      [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {
        alert(`hint: ${hint}`);
        return hint == "string" ? `{name: "${this.name}"}` : this.money;
      }
    };
    
    // conversions demo:
    alert(user); // hint: string -> {name: "John"}
    alert(+user); // hint: number -> 1000
    alert(user + 500); // hint: default -> 1500
    ```
